      A common CentOS build process is to netboot a bare minimum OS and use that as a base to build on. This minimum kernel is booted and runs the 'minecraft.ks' kickstart file. A kickstart file contains answers to all the questions that would normally be asked during a CentOS installation. Our kickstart file is very minimal since we do as much of the system configuration in puppet as we can.
      Packer automatically starts a http server in this directory that we can access via the special variables .HTTPIP and .HTTPPort. That's how the kickstart file is served. 
      The amazon-ebs builder logs in to AWS for you and boots up a machine to create the AMI for you. So you have to pay for 1 hour of that instance running (currently a whopping $0.0065 for t2.nano).
