# AWS Minecraft Utilities
This repo currently contains utilities to run a minecraft server on EC2. For a server that only turns on a few hours a week, this is very cost-effective.

Maybe one day I will make this entirely automatic and configurable. Until then, I hope some of these pieces are useful to you.
